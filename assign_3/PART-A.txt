Producer is terminated so there is nothing to consume. The pipe is
empty and when consumer tries to consume there is an error and no 
value is read.

When consumer is terminated the connection between producer and cosumer
is broken and the value produced by producer cannot be read by any
consumer.

When multiple producers send value to one consumer all the values are 
read by the consumer. But when the producers are many and the pipe
storage limit is reached no further values can be sent to consumer
via pipe. So some producers wait for consumer to read value from pipe.
But even when the values are read the producers are not guaranteed to
woken up. So they can be in sleep mode forever.

When one producer sends value to multiple consumers then the values are
read by all consumers. But it happens that there aren't enough values to 
be read and some consumers go to sleep and are never woken up.

When multiple producers and consumers are there if the producers send value
that consumers are not able to read(overflow occurs) then some producers 
stop producing but it happens that they are not woken up again.
If there are less values to consume(underflow occurs) some consumers wait
for values and they might wait forever as other consumer reads value. 

For part-C we can make a character device in which producer will write
value and from there consumer will read values. Semaphore will we used
as we don't want to write anything to character device if buffer is
full and we don't want anything to be read if the buffer is empty.
Also through semaphore we can ensure that only one process can read 
value or write value in buffer. So mutual exclusion of producer and 
consumer is ensured and overflow as well as underflow conditions are
also checked.
